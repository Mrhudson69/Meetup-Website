# Meetup-Website

**This website is currently under development.**

The purpose of this website is simple â€“ akin to dating. Individuals, whether girls or boys, can apply here to work online and get paid.

In terms of design, several features are envisioned:
1. A user page needs to be designed, allowing users to visit and swipe right or left. If they find someone interesting, they can initiate calls or chats based on their preferences. Another page is dedicated to admins, accessible exclusively to them.
2. Admins have control over who appears on the website. They can block individuals immediately with a single button.
3. Banned individuals can submit unban requests, which admins will handle.
4. Admins can determine the percentage earned by featured individuals on the website; the default is 80%.
5. Post-call, users can provide a star rating out of 5 based on their interactions.
6. Ratings are visible on the homepage.
7. Only online members are visible on the first page of the website.
8. If a user disconnects a call, there is no refund. However, if the call is disconnected by the service provider, a refund is issued.
9. Admins have access to all transactions to decide on refund eligibility.
10. Applicants can set their rates for 30 minutes, 1 hour, or 2 hours, along with a personal bio visible on their profile.
11. Calls require audio and video permissions; they won't start without user consent.
12. A terms and conditions policy is mandatory.
13. Users must accept a rules and regulations policy before initiating a call.
14. Account creation involves a standard login page. Users need to upload a front-camera-taken photo for admin approval. Upon approval, users receive a confirmation email.
15. Additional features will be added soon; updates will follow.
